/**
 * Close the process's own handles inside teams/<team> and tasks/<team> right
 * before permanent deletion renames those directories aside.
 *
 * Windows refuses to rename a directory while any handle inside its tree is
 * open, and a directory watcher's handle stays open until the watcher is
 * closed - it never clears on its own, so the transient rename retry cannot
 * outlast it. The handles this app holds are the two chokidar watch sets and
 * the log-source watcher on teams/<team>/task-log-freshness.
 *
 * Every step is best effort. A failure to release means the rename falls back
 * to the transient retry, which is exactly where it was before, so one broken
 * releaser must not stop the others from running or abort the deletion.
 *
 * Restoring is not symmetric with releasing. The directory watchers are always
 * resumed, because resuming a team whose directory is gone finds nothing to
 * watch. The log-source consumers are only put back when the deletion did not
 * complete: they are owned by the stall monitor and the task-log stream, which
 * would otherwise keep a team they believe they own without receiving its
 * events - and re-acquiring them for a team that was actually deleted would
 * warm a watcher on a directory that no longer exists.
