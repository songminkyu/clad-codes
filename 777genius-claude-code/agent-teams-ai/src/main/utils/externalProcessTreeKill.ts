/**
 * Ends a process tree this app never spawned, addressed by pid alone.
 *
 * `killProcessByPid` is not this. On Windows it shells out to `taskkill /T`,
 * which does reap the tree; on POSIX it is a bare `process.kill(pid, SIGTERM)`,
 * which reaches exactly one process. A sweep that reaps an external lead to free
 * the port the lead's tree is holding gets nothing from that on macOS or Linux:
 * the socket handle the port is held by was inherited, so it lives in the
 * children too, and they are reparented rather than signalled.
 *
 * `killProcessTreeAndWait` in `childProcess.ts` does walk the tree, but it takes
 * a `ChildProcess` and reads the process-group ownership this app recorded when
 * it spawned it. Neither exists for a process another program started, so the
 * walk is repeated here from the process table alone.
 *
 * Killing by process group is deliberately NOT how this works. `kill(-pgid)` is
 * one syscall instead of a walk, but a pgid is only safe to address when this
 * app is the one that created the group: an external process that never called
 * `setsid` sits in the group of whoever launched it, and on a lead launched from
 * a terminal that group can contain this app's own process. The walk costs one
 * `ps` and cannot make that mistake.
