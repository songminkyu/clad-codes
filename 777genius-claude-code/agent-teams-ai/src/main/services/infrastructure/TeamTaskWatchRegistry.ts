 *   Large ~/.claude/teams trees can hit EMFILE/ENOSPC and freeze startup work.
 * - FileWatcher only consumes a small set of team/task JSON artifacts, so a
 *   broad recursive watcher mostly watches runtime/log/member noise.
 *
 * Contract:
 * - Watch only teams/, teams/<team>/, teams/<team>/inboxes/, tasks/, tasks/<team>/.
 *   Team root/task scope and inbox scope can differ: inboxes are normally only
 *   watched for live/running teams.
 * - Do not enable Chokidar polling here. Polling is owned by FileWatcher fallback.
 * - Initial app startup baseline stays silent except for explicitly scoped live
 *   inboxes when backfillInitialScopedInboxFiles is enabled.
 * - Newly discovered targets are scanned once so files created before rebuild
 *   are not lost.
