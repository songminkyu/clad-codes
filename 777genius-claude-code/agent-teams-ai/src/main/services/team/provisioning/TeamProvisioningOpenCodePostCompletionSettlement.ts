/**
 * Post-completion settlement for the OpenCode member inbox relay.
 *
 * Once every live task on the board is completed and the team has already
 * messaged the user after the last structural board event, the app-generated
 * notices that keep trickling in (task "done" notices, comment notifications,
 * task-state notices) carry nothing the recipient can act on.
 * Each of them still cost a full runtime turn, and because a turn is memoryless
 * the recipient kept re-answering work that was finished before the notice was
 * even written.
 *
 * While the team stays settled, such a notice and the reply-optional notices
 * queued behind it are read-committed together, without a prompt. Any
 * structural board change or a new message from the user ends the settled state
 * and normal delivery resumes.
 *
 * The board predicate is re-implemented here rather than shared with the
 * controller: the controller applies the same rule to `message_send`, where a
 * post-completion agent->user message comes back as a success-shaped duplicate
 * instead of a rephrased recap. The two halves share a rule, not a module, so
 * neither side has to reach across the process boundary to evaluate it.
