/**
 * The one place that decides whether a relay's diagnostics reach the log.
 *
 * A relay result is the only account the app gives of why a message did or did
 * not reach a runtime, and exactly one caller turns it into a log line: the
 * FileWatcher inbox-change path in `src/main/index.ts`. Every other path that
 * relays discards the result, the retry/wake sweep included, so a lane that
 * keeps deferring is invisible: a retry wake that keeps deferring writes
 * nothing at all, and a ten-minute stall can produce no log line describing
 * itself. The two lines such a stretch does produce exist only because a new
 * inbox row happened to arrive and take the watched path.
 *
 * Concentrating the decision in a module is what lets the other paths adopt it
 * without each re-deriving the dedup and severity rules. The FileWatcher path
 * uses it today; the delivery retry path adopts it next.
 *
 * Being visible must not mean flooding. A busy inbox re-reports the same
 * diagnostics on every pass, so an unchanged condition writes at most once per
 * window while a CHANGED condition writes immediately: a transition is always
 * news, a repeat almost never is.

 * `warn` is the durable channel; `debug` and `info` are explicitly not.

 * `opencode_delivery_response_pending`, a scheduled session refresh - are
 * expected control flow and stay off that channel on purpose: a lane that
 * legitimately defers a wake every few seconds must not manufacture warnings.
 *
 * They are emitted at `debug` rather than `info`. Neither is durable and
 * neither prints at the default console level (WARN in development, ERROR in
 * production), but `debug` is the level an operator actually raises when
 * chasing a lane, while `info` is the level whose name suggests the line was
 * recorded somewhere. It was not. What an operator needs durably out of a
 * stalled lane is the warning allowlist, and that is unchanged.
