/**
 * Delivery-time self-heal for a primary lane that holds no committed session.
 *
 * When the primary lane's runtime never committed its session record, every
 * send is answered with a "no stored session" refusal and the ordinary retry
 * ladder cannot win: nothing a retry does can cause the missing commit to
 * happen, so the row spends its whole attempt budget in under a minute and then
 * stays terminal for the life of the team. The one signal that IS locally
 * decidable is the lane's own storage, so this module turns "the lane directory
 * holds no runtime evidence" into a bounded, exactly-once re-bootstrap of the
 * lead.
 *
 * Every constant here is a margin against healing a lane that is merely slow. A
 * healthy lane can commit its session before its first refusal is even
 * observed, which is why the evidence check outranks the timer: a lane whose
 * evidence is already on disk is a race with the commit, never a heal.

/**
 * The env switch for the ladder, and the reason it ships OFF.
 *
 * This module was written against a symptom whose cause turned out to be
 * elsewhere: on the aggregate launch path the lead was never included in the
 * roster handed to the orchestrator, so no launch command was ever sent for it.
 * See `docs/team-management/opencode-lead-session-root-cause.md` for the full
 * account, including the bridge-ledger evidence.
 *
 * That defect is closed - incidentally, by a facade refactor
 * (`55dbb5010`, 2026-07-20) that re-plans the lane plan from a roster which
 * already carries the lead. So the ladder no longer has the failure it was
 * written for.
 *
 * Two reasons it is off by default:
 *
 * 1. Its motivating cause is gone. What remains is a mechanism that stops and
 *    relaunches a lead - discarding its context and spending tens of seconds -
 *    for failure modes nobody has characterised yet. Off is the honest default
 *    for that.
 * 2. Relaunching a lead nobody asked to relaunch has a blast radius. The
 *    lane-storage probe keys off a fixed set of evidence filenames; if that
 *    layout ever changes, healthy lanes start reading as unbootstrapped and
 *    every user's lead restarts twice per run, with no way to stop it short of
 *    a release.
 *
 * It is kept rather than deleted because a bootstrap CAN still fail for reasons
 * unrelated to the closed defect - the evidence commit is skipped in silence
 * when a member is confirmed without a session id, and until
 * `agent_teams_orchestrator#65` a failed bootstrap deleted its own session
 * record. Turn it on deliberately, for a reproduction you understand.
 *
 * With it off the lane still refuses the unwinnable send and the delivery row
 * still settles - it just settles terminal immediately instead of after a
 * bounded ladder, and no relaunch is ever started.
