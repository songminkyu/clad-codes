 * the runtime proxy is pinned to, and every lane launched afterwards is routed
 * through it: wrong workspace, wrong profile, none of the user's own MCP
 * servers. Nothing else reaps it, because it is not in the registry the sweep
 * just cleaned.
 *
 * Every step here is destructive, so every step is fenced twice. A start time
 * keeps out anything younger than the fence: without it the sweep reaped the
 * `opencode serve` host of a readiness probe a user launch had just started,
 * and refused that launch before its first state-changing bridge command. And
 * this app instance's own ownership markers keep out every host it did not
 * start, so a second install, or an orchestrator a user runs themselves, is
 * never a candidate for the reap however old it is.
