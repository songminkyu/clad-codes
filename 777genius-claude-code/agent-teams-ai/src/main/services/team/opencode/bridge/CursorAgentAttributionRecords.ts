/**
 * The `cursor-agent` processes the runtime has recorded as its own, read back
 * by the app that designated where to record them.
 *
 * A lead is spawned by `opencode serve`, never by this app, and a process table
 * answers with a JOINED command line that cannot be split back into the argv
 * the spawner used. Nothing the app can observe therefore tells one team's lead
 * from another's, or from a `cursor-agent --print` the user started in the same
 * directory - the gap the sweep header in `CursorAgentProcessCleanup.ts`
 * describes. The process that does know is the spawned one: it records its own
 * pid, its own start time and its own `--workspace` argument, into a directory
 * this app names in the bridge environment (`AGENT_TEAMS_PROCESS_ATTRIBUTION_DIR`).
 *
 * Two files joined by one id, because a serve host is keyed by project and
 * profile scope while the team, run and lane it works for is a lease set that
 * changes while the host lives:
 *
 * - `v1/agents/<attributionId>/<pid>-<startedAtMs>.json` - written by the agent
 *   process itself, so its pid and argv are exact;
 * - `v1/hosts/<attributionId>.json` - written by the runtime that spawned it,
 *   carrying the owners that host currently holds leases for.
 *
 * This module reads, and what it reads is identity - never liveness. A record
 * outlives a SIGKILL, so a caller that acts on one has to re-read the live start
 * time itself and kill in the same turn as that check; that fence belongs where
 * the kill is, and lands with the proof path rather than here. Unreadable or
 * invalid agent records contribute nothing. A readable agent whose host cannot
 * be validated carries an unnamed owner, so missing host evidence cannot be
 * mistaken for an explicitly released lease set.
