/**
 * A cursor-acp team lead is not an OpenCode host. It is an external
 * `cursor-agent` process the orchestrator spawns, and it brings a whole tree
 * with it: a shell wrapper, a node runtime, and whatever tool processes the
 * lead started. None of those are in the host registry, so stopping the team
 * reaches none of them.
 *
 * What survives is not idle. The lead keeps calling the Agent Teams MCP server
 * for a team that no longer exists, and an inherited socket handle keeps the
 * fixed cursor proxy port in LISTEN, so the next cursor-acp launch waits out its
 * readiness probe against a port that answers for a dead team.
 *
 * This sweep reaps whole trees, and it may only reap one it can prove belongs to
 * this app. The proof is the process itself, never a pid this app happens to
 * have written down: the command line has to carry `--print`, which is how the
 * orchestrator spawns a lead and not how a user runs the interactive agent, and
 * a `--workspace` that matches - exactly - a workspace the caller owns. Lineage
 * carries the proof down: what stands below a root this app can name belongs to
 * that root, so the whole tree is reaped with it.
 *
 * A command line is not the only proof available any more. A runtime that
 * records the agent processes it spawns writes that record from INSIDE the
 * spawned process, where the pid, the start time and the `--workspace` argument
 * are exact rather than joined into one string, and a root such a record answers
 * for is attributed without reading any environment - which is the only
 * ownership proof Windows and macOS can produce at all. A record is identity and
 * never liveness: it outlives a `SIGKILL`, so every fence below still re-reads
 * the live process itself before anything is signalled.
 *
 * Reaping it is a walk, not one signal. `killExternalProcessTree` reads the
 * process table, orders the tree deepest-first and signals each pid in turn,
 * because on macOS and Linux a signal to the root reaches the root and nothing
 * else - and the port this sweep exists to free is held by an INHERITED socket
 * handle, which means the children hold it too. Signalling only the root leaves
 * the port in LISTEN and the sweep reporting success.
