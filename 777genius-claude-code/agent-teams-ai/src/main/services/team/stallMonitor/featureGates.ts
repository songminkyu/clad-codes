  // member for as long as the jam lasts.
  //
  // ORDERING INVARIANT: this must sit at or above every OpenCode stall
  // threshold whose `lane_active` guard it can unlock, or the guard becomes
  // unreachable for exactly the turns it exists to protect. The registry stamps
  // 'active' once, at prompt acceptance, and never refreshes it during a turn,
  // so a four-minute bound would demote every OpenCode turn longer than four
  // minutes: a member five minutes into a legitimate turn would be nudged
  // mid-generation by the weak-start branch, and the backdated idle time would
  // rewrite its ten-minute mid-turn signal into the four-minute turn-ended one.
  // Ten minutes is the largest of those thresholds
  // (WORK_THRESHOLDS_MS.mid_turn_after_touch in TeamTaskStallPolicy), so a
  // demoted sample can never make a work branch fire earlier than that branch's
  // own threshold.
  //
  // The pickup branch pays the cost, and pays it in full: a demotion publishes
  // the ORIGINAL observation time as `idleSince` (classifyOpenCodeLaneTurnSample
  // keeps it there on purpose, so the bound cannot restart the clock), and that
  // time is already older than the five-minute pickup threshold at the moment
  // of demotion. A member honestly ten minutes into one turn therefore takes a
  // pickup nudge for a task still sitting in `pending`. That is the deliberate
  // trade: the nudge queues behind the turn in flight rather than interrupting
  // it, while the alternative - trusting the flag indefinitely - is a jammed
  // lane switching the detector off for as long as the jam lasts.
  //
  // openCodeLaneTurnFreshness.test.ts holds this ordering as a test, so
  // lowering the default below any of those thresholds fails the build. This is
  // the raw reader: an environment override is not a default and no test can
  // pin it, so `resolveOpenCodeLaneTurnActivityMaxAgeMs` (openCodeLaneTurnFreshness)
  // raises an under-floor override back to the floor before the snapshot
  // applies it. Read that resolver, not this gate, to get the effective bound.
